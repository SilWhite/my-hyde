      "The duration to remove a wisdom tooth can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the complexity of the extraction, the position of the tooth, and the patient's overall dental health. Generally, a straightforward wisdom tooth removal, where the tooth is fully erupted and easily accessible, can take as little as 15 to 30 minutes. However, if the tooth is impacted, meaning it is trapped beneath the gum or bone, the procedure can be more involved and may require additional time, commonly ranging from 45 minutes to an hour or more. In cases of severe impaction or complications, the extraction process could extend even further. Post-operative care and recovery time can also vary, typically lasting from a few days to a couple of weeks. It is important to consult with a dental professional for a personalized assessment and to understand the specific timeline for your particular case.\n"
